Object Oriented Programming allows programmers to create their own objects
that have methods and attributes.

Recall that after defining a string, list, dictionary, or other objects, you were 
able to call methods of them with the .method_name() syntax.
Examples - .title() .index() .lower()

These methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as the 
object itself to return results, or change the current object.

For example this includes appending to a list, or counting the occurences of an element in 
a tuple.

OOP allows users to create their own objects.

The general format is often confusing when first encountered, and its usefulness may not be 
completely clear at first.

In general, OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized.

For much larger scripts of code, functions by themselves aren't enough for organization 
and repeatablility.

Commonly repeated tasks and objects can be defined with OOP to create code that is more usable.
